# Anagram Detector

The goal of this project is to determine if two texts are an anagram of each other.

## Description

## How to use

Run the application and put the http://localhost:8080 into the browser.

Once the page is loaded you can place both texts in the respective areas and use the button check to see if they are anagrams of each other.
